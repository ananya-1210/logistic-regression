ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset used is the Online Shoppers Intention Dataset, which includes 18 features and a target label (Revenue). It reflects real user interaction logs from an e-commerce website.
Features: Page values, Product durations, Exit rates, Bounce rates, Month, Visitor Type, Weekend, etc.
Target: Revenue (True/False) â€” indicating whether the user made a purchase.

ðŸ§  Models Used
We implemented and evaluated the following classification models:
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier

ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics
Each model was assessed using:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
These metrics help understand the trade-off between false positives and false negatives, which is especially important for imbalanced datasets like this one.

ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
This project demonstrates a practical application of classification models to real-world behavioral data. Random Forest and Logistic Regression emerged as the best-performing models for predicting user purchase behavior.
